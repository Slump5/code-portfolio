/**
 * @brief Main function to interactively manage blocks.
 * 
 * This function provides an interactive menu-driven interface for managing and querying blocks. 
 * It performs the following steps:
 * 
 * 1. Creates a block file from an input CSV file.
 * 2. Parses the block file to populate the global `blocks` map.
 * 3. Enters an infinite loop providing the user with the following options:
 *    - Dump all blocks in physical order.
 *    - Dump all blocks in logical order.
 *    - Query a specific block by its RBN.
 *    - Exit the program.
 * 
 * The user can query the details of a specific block by entering its RBN, including
 * availability, records, and predecessor/successor RBNs.
 * 
 * @return int Exit code. Returns 0 if successful.
