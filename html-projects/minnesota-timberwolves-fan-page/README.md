# Minnesota Timberwolves Fan Page

## Overview
This project is a static fan website titled "Minnesota Timberwolves Fan Page," created by Thomas Hoerger to support the Minnesota Timberwolves NBA team and inform fans about its players and history. It utilizes HTML for structure, CSS for fixed styling, and includes images of players and the team logo. The design features a header with logo, navigation, multiple pages for player stats, team history, and more, and a footer.

## Features
- **Static Layout**: Uses fixed pixel measurements for widths, heights, margins, and padding to maintain a consistent design.
- **Multi-Page Structure**: Includes an index page and additional pages for player backgrounds, statistics, team stats, history, and bibliography.
- **Custom Styling**: Incorporates colors, fonts from Google Fonts (e.g., 'Open Sans' and 'Roboto Slab'), and background images for visual appeal.
- **Player Information**: Detailed backgrounds and stats for Anthony Edwards, Karl-Anthony Towns, Rudy Gobert, and D'Angelo Russell.
- **Team Data**: Includes team statistics and historical records.
- **Semantic HTML**: Utilizes elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<figure>`, and `<footer>` for better accessibility and SEO.
- **Commented Code**: CSS includes comments for clarity (e.g., pixel measurements), and HTML/CSS are organized for readability.
