# Timberwolves Island

## Overview
This project is a static fan website titled "Timberwolves Island," created by Thomas Hoerger to support the Minnesota Timberwolves NBA team and inform fans about its players and history. It utilizes HTML for structure, Bootstrap v3.3.7 for responsive layout and components, custom CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements like modals and dropdowns. The design features a navigation bar with dropdowns, player profiles, team history, and a contact modal, with a color scheme inspired by the Timberwolves (navy blues, greens, and grays).

## Features
- **Responsive Layout**: Uses Bootstrap's grid system and media queries for mobile-friendly design, unlike fixed layouts.
- **Multi-Page Structure**: Includes a home page and additional pages for team history and player profiles.
- **Custom Styling**: Incorporates team-themed colors (e.g., #0C2340 for body background, #78BE20 for articles), fonts from Google Fonts (e.g., 'Open Sans' and 'Roboto Slab'), and hover effects for thumbnails and buttons.
- **Player Information**: Detailed biographies and early life sections for Anthony Edwards, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Rudy Gobert.
- **Team Data**: Includes playoff history, top 10 players list, and personal goals from the creator.
- **Interactive Elements**: Bootstrap-powered navigation dropdown for players, contact modal, and button styles with hover states.
- **Semantic HTML**: Utilizes elements like `<nav>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` for better accessibility and SEO.
- **Commented Code**: Custom CSS includes comments organized alphabetically by element/class, and HTML pages are structured for readability.
