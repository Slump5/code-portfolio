                   <h3>About Anthony Edwards</h3>
                    <p>Anthony DeVante Edwards (born August 5, 2001), nicknamed "Ant-Man",[1] is an American professional basketball player for the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA). A shooting guard, he played college basketball for the Georgia Bulldogs.
Edwards finished his high school career at Holy Spirit Preparatory School in his hometown of Atlanta, where he was rated a consensus five-star recruit and one of the best players in the 2019 class by major recruiting services. As a senior, he earned McDonald's All-American and USA Today All-USA first team honors. He committed to play college basketball for Georgia, becoming the highest rated recruit to do so, and was named SEC Freshman of the Year after his freshman season with the team. He was selected with the first overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 2020 NBA Draft.</p>

                   <h3>Early Life</h3>
        
                    <p>Edwards spent his early life in Atlanta, Georgia. When he was three years old, he was given the nickname "Ant-Man" by his father. For much of his childhood, Edwards played football at the running back, quarterback, and cornerback positions.[2] He played youth football for the Atlanta Vikings and became one of the best Pop Warner running backs in the country by age 10.[2][3][4] However, Edwards switched his focus to basketball because he "thought it looked more fun" after watching his brothers play the sport. He often played basketball against his brothers at their grandmother's house. Entering ninth grade, he began training under the guidance of Justin Holland, a former college basketball player for Liberty and an Atlanta-based basketball trainer.[2]</p>
