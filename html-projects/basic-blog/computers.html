            <h2>Computer Storage Devices</h2>
            <p>Computer data storage is a technology that is used to retain digital data. It is a core function and fundamental component of computers.</p>
            <h3>The different types of modern storage are:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sata SSD</li>
                    <li>M.2 SSD</li>
                    <li>HDD</li>
                    <li>Cloud</li>
                </ul>

        <article class="c-article">
            <h2>Central processing unit (CPU)</h2>
            <p>A central processing unit is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions sent form a computer program. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output operations.</p>
            <h3>Different types of cpu:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Single-core CPU</li>
                <li>Dual-core CPU</li>
                <li>Quad-core CPU</li>
                <li>Hexa Core CPU</li>
                <li>Octa-core CPU</li>
                <li>Deca-core CPU</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The higher the core count the more efficent the processor is. The core count of a cpu affects how many commands it can execute simultaneously.</p>

            <h2>Motherboard</h2>
            <p>The motherboard is the main printed circuit board in computers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit and the memory. It also provides connectors so you can attach other peripherals.</p>
            <h3>Different motherboard sizes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>ATX</li>
                <li>Micro-ATX</li>
                <li>Mini-ITX</li>
            </ul>

        <article class="c-article">
            <h2>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h2>
            <p>RAM is a computer's short-term memory, where the data that the processor is currently using is stored. Your computer can access RAM memory much faster than data on a hard disk, SSD, or other long-term storage device, which is why RAM is critical for system performance.</p>
            <h3>Different types of RAM:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>SRAM(Static RAM)</li>
                <li>DRAM(Dynamic RAM)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Static RAM consist of circuits capable of retaining their state as long as power is on. Thus this type of memory is called volatile memory. DRAM stores the binary information in the form of electric charges applied to capacitors.</p>

            <h2>Video Graphics or Graphics Card</h2>
            <p>A graphics card is a computer expansion card that generates a feed of graphics output to a display device such as a monitor. Graphics cards are sometimes called discrete or dedicated graphics.</p>
            <h3>Different motherboard sizes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Integrated</li>
                <li>Dedicated</li>
            </ul>
            <p>An integrated graphics card shares power between the GPU and CPU, because the graphics card is built directly into the computer's processor. A dedicated graphics card is separate from the CPU and has its own dedicated memory.</p>

        <article class="c-article">
            <h2>Power supply</h2>
            <p>A power supply provides electricity to all components of a computer system. Typically, it's a power cord connected from the back of a PC tower into an electricity socket.</p>
            <h3>Different types of power supply:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Linear</li>
                <li>Switched</li>
                <li>Battery-based</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Direct current power supplies are either unregulated or regulated. A unregulated power supplies does not have voltage regulators built into them, they typically are designed to produce a specific voltage at a specific maximum output. A regulated power supply is an unregulated power supply with the addition of a voltage regulator. This allows the voltage to stay stable regardless of the amount of current.</p>
