# Weather Database Viewer Site Stage 1

## Overview
This is a project focused on designing and implementing a Weather Database. It fulfills the requirements outlined in the instructions for Project 1, submitted by Thomas Hoerger on 2/24/2025. The project demonstrates the creation of a database with at least five tables, each containing 30 records, a client-side query display, and functionality showcased through multiple queries. The database is hosted on a Linux VPS using phpMyAdmin for management.

## Features
- **Database Definition:** Designed a Weather Database with at least five tables, each populated with 30 records, covering aspects such as weather stations, measurements, locations, weather conditions, and timestamps.
- **Client-Side Connection:** Implemented a database connection using PHP scripts (`db_connect.php` and `weather_display.php`) to display query results on the client side via HTML.
- **Presentable Output:** Formatted output tables in a user-friendly manner, including a conversion of temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit for improved readability.
- **Query Demonstration:** Executed at least three distinct queries, including:
  - Retrieving the five coldest locations.
  - Counting the number of days recorded as "Rainy."
  - Identifying the five windiest locations.
- **VPS Hosting:** Successfully deployed and ran the database on a Linux Virtual Private Server (VPS), with phpMyAdmin used for management.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation of the setup, design, and query processes, as detailed in the seven-page project submission (`Project 1 - Group 9.pdf`).

## File Structure
- **stage1-weather-database-viewer-site.pdf:** Main project submission document detailing the database design, queries, and VPS setup (7 pages).
- **instructions.pdf:** Course instructions for Project 1, outlining the requirements for the Favorite Topic Database (5 pages).
